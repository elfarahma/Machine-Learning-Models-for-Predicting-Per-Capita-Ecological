# Machine Learning Model for Ecological Footprint Prediction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a machine learning-based model developed to predict the ecological footprint of a countryâ€™s population. The model utilizes demographic inputs such as Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy, along with geographic features like continent, to make predictions.
